The goal of ggmouse is to …

## Installation

You can install the released version of ggmouse from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ggmouse")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("marcosci/ggmouse")
```

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub!
